        Statistics and Prevention of Climate Change
    </h1>

    <p class = "statsp">
        Global temperatures have surged by about 1.2 degrees Celsius since the late 19th century, with a notable escalation in recent decades. Atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have exceeded 400 parts per million (ppm), far surpassing pre-industrial levels. This rise is attributed to extensive fossil fuel usage and deforestation. Sea levels have surged by approximately 8-9 inches since 1880, and the rate of increase is accelerating due to glacier melt and seawater expansion. The repercussions extend to glacial retreat, escalating extreme weather occurrences, ocean acidification, and biodiversity loss. On a positive note, renewable energy adoption has grown remarkably, offering hope for reducing emissions. International efforts, symbolized by the Paris Agreement adopted in 2015, reflect a commitment to curbing global warming and promoting sustainability. For the most current insights, referencing recent reports and scientific literature is advisable.

        Individuals have the power to make a meaningful impact in preventing climate change through a range of sustainable practices. By reducing their carbon footprint, such as opting for public transport, carpooling, or using energy-efficient vehicles, people can lessen emissions. Employing energy-saving strategies like using efficient appliances and adopting renewable energy sources like solar panels or wind energy helps conserve resources. Making mindful choices, like supporting local and organic foods, minimizing water usage, and embracing reusable products, contributes to sustainable consumption. Advocating for sustainable industries, reducing single-use plastics, and promoting tree planting and green space preservation also play a pivotal role. Additionally, individuals can raise awareness, advocate for policy changes, and foster eco-conscious behaviors to collectively address climate change.
